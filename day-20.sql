-- Title: Hot Cocoa Break Logs

-- Question:
-- Jack Frost wants to review all the cocoa breaks he actually took — including the cocoa type and the location he drank it in. How would you combine the necessary tables to show each logged break with its matching cocoa details and location?

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: cocoa_logs
--   log_id: INT
--   break_id: INT
--   cocoa_id: INT
--
-- Table: break_schedule
--   break_id: INT
--   location_id: INT
--
-- Table: cocoa_types
--   cocoa_id: INT
--   cocoa_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: locations
--   location_id: INT
--   location_name: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

select cl.log_id,cl.break_id,ct.cocoa_name,l.location_name  from cocoa_logs cl 
  join break_schedule b on cl.break_id=b.break_id
  join locations l on l.location_id=b.location_id
  join cocoa_types ct on ct.cocoa_id=cl.cocoa_id;
