# SQL Advent Calendar 2024

This repository contains my solutions to Interview Master's 24-day SQL Advent Calendar challenge.

## About the Challenge

The SQL Advent Calendar is a festive coding challenge featuring 24 days of SQL problems, hosted by [Interview Master](https://www.interviewmaster.ai/advent). It's a great opportunity to practice diverse SQL concepts including:
- Query optimization
- Window functions
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Aggregate functions
- Data manipulation and transformation
- Complex joins and subqueries

## Repository Structure

└── README.md
```

Each file contains the SQL solution for the corresponding day's challenge.

## Skills Demonstrated

- ✅ **SQL Query Writing**: Crafting efficient and readable SQL queries
- ✅ **Data Analysis**: Extracting meaningful insights from data
- ✅ **Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex problems into SQL solutions
- ✅ **Database Design**: Understanding relational database concepts
- ✅ **Performance**: Writing optimized queries

## How to Use

1. Browse through the `day-*.sql` files to see the solutions
2. Each file is self-contained and can be executed independently
3. Modify and test the queries in your SQL environment (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.)

## Key Learnings

Through this challenge, I've strengthened my understanding of:
- Advanced SQL functions and operators
- Query optimization techniques
- Real-world data scenarios
- Best practices for SQL code organization
